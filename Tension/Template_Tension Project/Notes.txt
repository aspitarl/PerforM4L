To load in new samples

get a sample to 4 bars in length and consolidate/crop

drag into 3rd row out of 5 of drum rack. 8 bar on bottom


sampler settings:

classic, set release to zero,  warp complex

then copy into other 5 slots and stretch to right time

Changes needed: 

Need to just use a max for live device to send the right duration note.  Right now swell required to be in one shot mode so that the midi note doesn't stop after 8 bars
