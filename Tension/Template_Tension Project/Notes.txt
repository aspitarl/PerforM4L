To load in new samples

get a sample to 4 bars in length and consolidate/crop

drag into 3rd row out of 5 of drum rack. 8 bar on bottom


sampler settings:

classic, set release to zero,  warp complex

then copy into other 5 slots and stretch to right time

Development plan: 

Tech spec:

Can get a sample of any length and drop into slot in drum rack, don't have to make different warp versions. 
able to either control the warping, or at least know when a certian lenght is unavailable
able to start with one button and also panic exit.
abrubt and tail version (swell can be different sample)
output is recorded in arrangement view. 

Implementation:
check this out
https://www.az-labs.com/downloads/simpler-tools-drum-rack-control/

can just use this to choose and warp the sample as needed

Then just have samples in oneshot mode, and use a choke for panic button

Potentially just one midi track as the knobs should be automated now.
